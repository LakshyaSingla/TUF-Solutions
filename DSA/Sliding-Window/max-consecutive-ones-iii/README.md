## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a binary array **nums** and an integer **k** , flip at most k 0's.

Return the **maximum** number of **consecutive 1's** after performing the flipping operation.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] , k = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** The maximum number of consecutive 1's are obtained only if we flip the 0's present at position 3, 4, 5 (0 base indexing).

The array after flipping becomes [1, 1, 1, <u>1</u>, <u>1</u>, <u>1</u>, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

The number of consecutive 1's is 10.

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] , k = 3

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** The underlines 1's are obtained by flipping 0's in the new array.

[<u>1</u>, <u>1</u>, 1, 1, 1, <u>1</u>, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1].

The number of consecutive 1's is 9.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1
- 0 <= k <= nums.length

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
