## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer k and a string s, any character in the string can be selected and changed to any other uppercase English character. This operation can be performed up to **k** times. After completing these steps, return the **length** of the longest substring that contains the same letter.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** s = "BAABAABBBAAA" , k = 2</p><p>

**Output:** 6</p><p>

**Explanation:** we can change the B present at index 0 , 3 (0 base indexing) to A.</p>The new string is "<u>A</u>AA<u>A</u>AABBBAAA".

The substring "AAAAAA" is the longest substring having same letter with length 6.

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** s = "AABABBA" , k = 1</p><p>

**Output:** 4</p><p>

**Explanation:** The underlined characters are changed in the new string obtained.</p>The new string is "AAB<u>B</u>BBA". The substring "BBBB" is the answer.

There are other ways to achieve this answer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= k <= s.length
- s contains only English uppercase letters.
