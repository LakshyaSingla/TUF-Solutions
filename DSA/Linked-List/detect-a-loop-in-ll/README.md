## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list. Return true if a **loop** exists in the linked list or return false.

A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Internally, pos is used to denote the index(0-based) of the node from where the loop starts. Note&nbsp;that pos is not passed as a parameter.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1</p><p>

**Output:** true</p><p>

**Explanation:** The tail of the linked list connects to the node at 1st index.</p>

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1</p><p>

**Output:** false</p><p>

**Explanation:** No loop is present in the linked list.</p>

### Constraints

- 0 <= number of nodes in the cycle <= 10^5
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 10^4
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list
