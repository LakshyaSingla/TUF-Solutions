## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the **head** of a singly linked list representing a positive **integer** number. **Each** node of the linked list represents a **digit** of the number, with the 1st node containing the leftmost digit of the number and so on. The task is to **add one** to the value represented by the linked list and **return** the head of a linked list containing the final value.

The number will contain **no** leading zeroes except when the value represented is **zero** itself.

### Example 1:

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

**Output:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 4

**Explanation:** The number represented by the linked list = 123.

123 + 1 = 124.

### Example 2:

**Input:** head -> 9 -> 9

**Output:** head -> 1 -> 0 -> 0

**Explanation:** The number represented by the linked list = 99.

99 + 1 = 100.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 0 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 10^5
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 9
- No leading zeroes in the value represented.

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
