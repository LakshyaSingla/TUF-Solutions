## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the **head** of a singly linked list representing a positive **integer** number. **Each** node of the linked list represents a **digit** of the number, with the 1st node containing the leftmost digit of the number and so on. The task is to **add one** to the value represented by the linked list and **return** the head of a linked list containing the final value.

The number will contain **no** leading zeroes except when the value represented is **zero** itself.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3</p><p>

**Output:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 4</p><p>

**Explanation:** The number represented by the linked list = 123.</p>123 + 1 = 124.

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** head -> 9 -> 9</p><p>

**Output:** head -> 1 -> 0 -> 0</p><p>

**Explanation:** The number represented by the linked list = 99.</p>99 + 1 = 100.

### Constraints

- 0 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 10^5
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 9
- No leading zeroes in the value represented.
