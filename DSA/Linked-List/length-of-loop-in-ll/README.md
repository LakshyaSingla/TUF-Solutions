## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, find the length of the loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the length of the loop if it exists; otherwise, return 0.

A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.

Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1</p><p>

**Output:** 4</p><p>

**Explanation:** 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 - >2, length of loop = 4.</p>

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1</p><p>

**Output:** 0</p><p>

**Explanation:** No loop is present in the linked list.</p>

### Constraints

- 0 <= number of nodes in the cycle <= 10^5
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 10^4
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list
