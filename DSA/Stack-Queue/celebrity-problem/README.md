## 📝 Problem Statement

A celebrity is a person who is known by everyone else at the party but does not know anyone in return. Given a square matrix M of size N x N where M[i][j] is 1 if person i knows person j, and 0 otherwise, determine if there is a celebrity at the party. Return the **index** of the **celebrity** or -1 if no such person exists.

**Note** that M[i][i] is always 0.

### Example 1:

Input: M = [ [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: Person 1 does not know anyone and is known by persons 0, 2, and 3. Therefore, person 1 is the celebrity.

### Example 2:

Input: M = [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Output: -1

Explanation: Both persons know each other, so there is no celebrity.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- &nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= N <= 3000
- &nbsp;&nbsp;0 <= M[][] <= 1
