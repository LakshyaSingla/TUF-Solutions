## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, determine the range of a subarray, defined as the difference between the largest and smallest elements within the subarray. Calculate and return the sum of all **subarray ranges** of nums.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous, non-empty sequence of elements within the array.

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 4

Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:

[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0&nbsp;

[2], range = 2 - 2 = 0

[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0

[1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1

[2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1

[1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2

So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 3]

Output: 4

Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:

[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0

[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0

[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0

[1,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2

[3,3], range = 3 - 3 = 0

[1,3,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2

So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

·&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= nums.length <= 1000

·&nbsp;&nbsp;-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
